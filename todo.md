1. **Blockchain Network**: Use Ethereum as the underlying blockchain platform due to its smart contract capabilities and widespread adoption

2. **Smart Contracts**: Develop smart contracts using Solidity to handle the voting logic, including voter registration, ballot creation, and vote counting

3. **Consensus Mechanism**: Implement Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus for a permissioned blockchain network, ensuring faster transactions and energy efficiency

4. **Frontend Application**: Create a user-friendly interface using Vue.js 3 for a responsive and dynamic web application

5. **Backend Server**: Develop the backend using Golang for high performance and efficient memory management

6. **Identity Management**: Implement a decentralized identity system using Ethereum's native account system or integrate with existing eID systems

## Key Components

1. **Voter Registration Module**: 
   - Implement KYC (Know Your Customer) verification
   - Generate unique Blockchain IDs (BCTIDs) for each voter

2. **Ballot Creation Module**:
   - Allow administrators to create and deploy voting events
   - Store ballot information in smart contracts

3. **Voting Module**:
   - Enable secure vote casting using cryptographic signatures
   - Implement homomorphic encryption for vote privacy

4. **Vote Counting and Verification Module**:
   - Automate vote tallying through smart contracts
   - Provide public verifiability of results

5. **Audit Trail System**:
   - Implement a transparent logging system for all voting activities
   - Allow voters to verify their own votes without compromising anonymity

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up the Ethereum development environment using tools like Truffle or Hardhat.

2. Develop and deploy smart contracts for voter registration, ballot management, and vote counting.

3. Create a Vue.js frontend that interacts with the smart contracts through Web3.js.

4. Implement the backend server in Golang to handle off-chain operations and API endpoints.

5. Use Docker for containerization and Railway for efficient deployment[6].

6. Implement security measures such as multi-factor authentication and encryption for data protection[8].

7. Conduct thorough testing using tools like Postman for API testing and Truffle for smart contract testing[6].

8. Deploy the system on a private Ethereum network or a public testnet for initial trials.

By following this architecture and using these technologies, you can create a secure, transparent, and efficient Decentralized Voting System. Remember to prioritize security, privacy, and usability throughout the development process.
